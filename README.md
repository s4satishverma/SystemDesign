4. Architectural Patterns
   
Client-Server Architecture ‚Äì Central server serving multiple clients.

Microservices Architecture ‚Äì Independent services communicating via APIs.

Serverless Architecture ‚Äì Functions executed on demand without managing servers.

Low-Level Design (LLD) Resources

Fundamental Concepts

Basics of OOP ‚Äì Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use; prefer many specific interfaces over one general.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, to reduce coupling.

DRY Principle ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself.

YAGNI Principle ‚Äì You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It.

KISS Principle ‚Äì Keep It Simple, Stupid.


‚öôÔ∏è Design Patterns 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Creational Patterns
Focus: Object creation mechanisms.

1. Singleton
Definition: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point.

Use Case: Database connections, logging, configuration.

Example: Logger.getInstance() returns the same object every time.

2. Factory Method
Definition: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Use Case: Creating objects without specifying their exact class.

Example: ShapeFactory.createShape("circle") returns a Circle object.

3. Abstract Factory
Definition: Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Use Case: UI toolkits for multiple OS themes.

Example: GUIFactory creates Button and Checkbox for Windows or Mac.

4. Builder
Definition: Constructs complex objects step-by-step.

Use Case: Creating objects with many optional fields.

Example: PizzaBuilder.setCheese().setPepperoni().build().

5. Prototype
Definition: Creates objects by cloning an existing object (prototype).

Use Case: Avoid costly object creation from scratch.

Example: car.clone() creates a copy with the same properties.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Structural Patterns
Focus: Object composition and structure.

1. Adapter
Definition: Converts one interface into another the client expects.

Use Case: Integrating legacy code with new systems.

Example: Adapter that makes OldPaymentSystem work with NewPaymentGateway.

2. Bridge
Definition: Separates abstraction from implementation so they can change independently.

Use Case: Decouple UI abstraction from platform-specific rendering.

Example: RemoteControl works with both SonyTV and SamsungTV.

3. Composite
Definition: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Use Case: File system hierarchy (files & folders).

Example: Folder.add(File) allows nesting.

4. Decorator
Definition: Adds new functionality to an object without altering its structure.

Use Case: Adding encryption to data streams.

Example: new EncryptedStream(new FileStream()).

5. Facade
Definition: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Use Case: Hiding complex library logic behind one API.

Example: VideoConverter.convert("file.mp4").

6. Flyweight
Definition: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.

Use Case: Rendering thousands of similar objects (e.g., game trees).

Example: Share TreeType data for many tree instances.

7. Proxy
Definition: Acts as a placeholder to control access to another object.

Use Case: Lazy initialization, access control, logging.

Example: ImageProxy loads the image only when needed.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Behavioral Patterns
Focus: Object interaction & responsibility distribution.

1. Iterator
Definition: Provides a way to sequentially access elements without exposing internal structure.

Use Case: Looping over collections.

Example: while(iterator.hasNext()) { ... }

2. Observer
Definition: Allows multiple objects (observers) to be notified of changes in another object (subject).

Use Case: Event systems, UI updates.

Example: Stock price change notifies all subscribed clients.

3. Strategy
Definition: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.

Use Case: Payment method selection at runtime.

Example: PaymentContext.setStrategy(new PayPal()).

4. Command
Definition: Encapsulates a request as an object.

Use Case: Undo/redo functionality.

Example: Command.execute() for ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù, ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù.

5. State
Definition: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

Use Case: Traffic light system.

Example: Context.setState(new GreenLight()).

6. Template Method
Definition: Defines the program skeleton in a method, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps.

Use Case: Data processing pipelines.

Example: DataParser.parse() where parsing steps are overridden.

7. Visitor
Definition: Separates algorithms from object structures they operate on.

Use Case: Applying new operations to a set of objects without modifying them.

Example: TaxVisitor applied to different Product objects.

8. Mediator
Definition: Central object that coordinates interactions between other objects.

Use Case: Chatroom managing messages between users.

Example: ChatRoom.sendMessage(user, msg).

9. Memento
Definition: Captures and restores an object‚Äôs state without exposing its internals.

Use Case: Save game checkpoints, undo operations.

Example: Editor.saveState() and Editor.restoreState().

10. Chain of Responsibility
Definition: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one processes it.

Use Case: Logging, request validation.

Example: AuthHandler ‚Üí DataHandler ‚Üí ResponseHandler.
