The Gossip Protocol (also called Epidemic Protocol) is a peer-to-peer communication mechanism used in distributed systems to spread information across all nodes in a cluster, in a scalable, fault-tolerant, and eventually consistent way.

Imagine you’re in an office of 100 employees:
	• You tell 3 colleagues that there’s free pizza in the cafeteria.
	• Each of them tells 3 more people, and so on.
	• Within minutes, everyone knows, even if you didn’t personally tell them.
You didn’t need a manager to send a broadcast email.
It’s fast, redundant, and resilient (even if someone’s offline, the news still spreads).
This is exactly how Gossip Protocol spreads system state across distributed nodes.

How It Works (Step-by-Step)
Let’s say we have 10 servers in a distributed system.
	1. Each node periodically wakes up (say every 1 second).
	2. It picks a few random peers (e.g., 2 nodes) and sends them the latest state (e.g., “I’m alive”, “Node 4 is down”).
	3. Those peers merge this info with their own and continue gossiping in the next round.
	4. After a few rounds, all nodes converge on the same view of the cluster.
This ensures eventual consistency and avoids overloading any central coordinator.

System Design 
Example: Cassandra / DynamoDB Cluster
When you insert data into an Amazon DynamoDB or Apache Cassandra cluster:
	• Each node maintains metadata about which nodes are alive and how data is replicated.
	• Instead of relying on a central heartbeat monitor, each node uses gossip to share its view of the cluster (up/down status, data version, etc.).
	• Even if one node goes down, others will quickly learn through gossip and reroute traffic.
Result: No single point of failure, faster fault detection, scalable membership management.
