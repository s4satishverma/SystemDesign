Scalability in High-Level System Design: A Deep Dive

What is Scalability?
Scalability is a system's ability to handle increased load by proportionally increasing resources while meeting SLOs (Service Level Objectives) like latency, throughput, and error rate. Think of it like a restaurant. If it gets more customers (load), it needs more chefs and tables (resources) to keep service fast (SLO). There are two primary ways to scale: Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up) üìà: This involves adding more resources to a single machine, such as a bigger CPU, more RAM, or a larger hard drive. It's like upgrading one chef to a master chef. It's simple and fast to implement, but you'll eventually hit a physical limit, and the cost per unit of resource can be very high. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out) ‚ÜîÔ∏è: This means adding more machines to your system. It's like hiring more chefs. This approach is more complex because it requires coordination between machines (like load balancers and distributed databases), but it offers a virtually unlimited capacity to grow.
