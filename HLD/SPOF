What is a Single Point of Failure?
A Single Point of Failure is any component in a system—hardware, software, network, or even a process—that, if it fails, causes the entire system to stop working.
In simpler terms, it’s a bottleneck. If it breaks, everything else downstream fails too.
And in high-level design, avoiding SPOFs is one of the key goals.

 Examples of Single Points of Failure
	1. Monolithic Database:
If your entire application depends on a single database instance, and that DB crashes, your whole app goes down.
	2. Load Balancer as SPOF:
Even a load balancer, which is designed to distribute traffic, can be a SPOF if there’s only one instance and it fails.
	3. Single Web Server:
One application server? If it crashes, users get nothing.
	
Where SPOFs Appear in High-Level Design
When creating a High-Level Design (HLD), SPOFs can appear in:
	• Application Layer: Single backend, API gateway, or microservice
	• Data Layer: Single database, cache layer (e.g., Redis), or file storage
	• Infrastructure Layer: Load balancers, DNS servers, CDNs
	• Networking: Single router, firewall, or network switch

How to Avoid SPOFs in HLD
	1. Redundancy:
Add multiple instances of critical components. For example:
		○ Use replicated databases
		○ Deploy multiple app servers
		○ Use redundant load balancers
	2. Failover Mechanisms:
Ensure that when one component fails, traffic or workload shifts automatically to a backup. Think of active-passive or active-active setups.
	3. Monitoring & Alerting:
Detect issues early before they become outages. Use tools like Grafana etc.
	4. Auto-scaling & Health Checks:
Use cloud services to automatically scale up instances and check the health of services.
	5. Decentralization:
In distributed systems, avoid putting too much responsibility on one component. Split duties between microservices or nodes.

Real-Life Analogy
Think of a Single Point of Failure like a traffic signal at a busy junction. If that signal breaks down and there’s no backup or police control, the whole area goes into chaos. Similarly, in systems, SPOFs can bring your architecture to a standstill.

Design Tip for Interviews
In interviews, always ask yourself: “If this component goes down, what happens to the system?”
If the answer is “everything stops”, that’s your SPOF.
and 
interviewers love to see candidates proactively addressing SPOFs with design patterns like replication, sharding, failover, and graceful degradation."

	AWS/Azure/GCP: All offer high availability zones to remove SPOFs
  Kubernetes: Ensures replica sets and auto-healing to handle failure at the pod level
