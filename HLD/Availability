What is Availability? 
Simple Definition: Availability is how much time your system is up and running when users need it.
Think of it like a store - if a store is open 99% of the time, that's its availability rate.
Formula to Calculate Availability
Availability (%) = (Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)) × 100
Key Terms:

Uptime: Time when your system works perfectly
Downtime: Time when your system is broken or under maintenance

Real Example 
If your website has 99.9% availability in a year:

Total minutes in a year: 525,600 minutes
Allowed downtime: 525.6 minutes (about 8.76 hours)
That means your site can only be down for less than 9 hours the entire year!

Remember: Each extra "9" is 10x better than the previous level!
Why is Availability Super Important? 
1. Happy Users = Happy Business

Users get frustrated when apps/websites don't work
Unhappy users = lost customers

2. Money Matters 

Every minute of downtime = lost revenue
Amazon loses millions per minute when down
Small businesses lose customers to competitors

3. Legal Stuff 

Many contracts have SLAs (Service Level Agreements)
Breaking SLAs = paying penalties
Some industries have legal requirements

4. Competitive Edge 

More reliable system = more customers
Trust builds over time, breaks instantly

How to Achieve High Availability 
1. Redundancy (Have Backups!)
Simple Rule: Never put all eggs in one basket
Types:

Server Redundancy: Multiple servers doing the same job
Database Redundancy: Backup databases ready to take over
Geographic Redundancy: Servers in different cities/countries

Example: Netflix has servers worldwide, so if one fails, others keep working.
2. Load Balancing (Share the Work)
What it does: Spreads user requests across multiple servers
Think of it like: Multiple checkout counters at a grocery store

One counter gets overwhelmed? Others handle the customers
One breaks down? Others keep working

Popular Tools:

AWS Load Balancer
Nginx
HAProxy

3. Failover Mechanisms (Auto-Switch)
Two Types:
Active-Passive:

One server works, one waits as backup
Like having a spare tire - only used when main tire fails

Active-Active:

All servers work together
Like having multiple engines on a plane

4. Data Replication (Copy Your Data)
Synchronous Replication:

Data copied instantly to backup
Slower but safer

Asynchronous Replication:

Data copied with small delay
Faster but slight risk of data loss

5. Monitoring and Alerts (Stay Aware)
Key Techniques:

Heartbeat Signals: Systems ping each other regularly
Health Checks: Automated tests run constantly
Alert Systems: Notify engineers immediately when problems occur

Popular Tools:

PagerDuty
OpsGenie
CloudWatch

Best Practices for High Availability 
1. Design for Failure

Assume everything will break eventually
Plan for the worst-case scenario

2. Use Multiple Data Centers

Don't put all servers in one location
Natural disasters, power outages happen

3. Implement Circuit Breakers

Stop bad requests from crashing your system
Like electrical fuses in your house

4. Practice Chaos Engineering

Intentionally break things to test your system
Netflix's "Chaos Monkey" randomly kills servers

5. Smart Caching

Store frequently used data closer to users
Reduces load on main servers

6. Plan for Traffic Spikes

Black Friday, viral content, sudden popularity
Auto-scaling helps handle unexpected load

Common Availability Patterns 
1. Active-Passive Setup
Primary Server (Active) ←→ Backup Server (Passive)

2. Active-Active Setup

3. Multi-Region Setup
Users → CDN → Load Balancer
                ↓
        Region 1  Region 2
        Servers   Servers

Key Takeaways for Your System Design 

Start with Requirements: How much downtime can your business tolerate?
Eliminate Single Points of Failure: If losing one component breaks everything, fix it
Monitor Everything: You can't fix what you don't know is broken
Test Your Failover: Practice switching to backups before you need to
Balance Cost vs Availability: Each extra "9" costs significantly more
Document Your Recovery Process: When systems fail, you need clear steps to fix them

Real-World Examples 
High Availability Systems:

Google: 99.99%+ availability
AWS: Multiple zones and regions
Banking Systems: Must be available 24/7
Emergency Services: Lives depend on availability

What Happens When They Fail:

Facebook outage (2021): $100+ million lost
AWS outage: Thousands of websites go down
Banking system down: ATMs stop working globally

Remember This Formula 
High Availability = Redundancy + Monitoring + Fast Recovery
The goal isn't to prevent all failures (impossible), but to recover so quickly that users barely notice!
