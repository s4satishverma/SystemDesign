In a distributed world, failures will happen — data center outages, cloud region failures, accidental deletions, or network collapses.
Disaster Recovery (DR) is the strategy that ensures your system can bounce back quickly and minimize downtime when such disasters strike.
Think of DR as your “Plan B” for survival - when something goes terribly wrong, you still deliver service to users.

Imagine you’re a cab driver earning daily income from your car.
One day, your car’s engine blows up (disaster!).
You have two options:
	• Option A: Wait a week to fix it (no income = downtime).
	• Option B: You already have a spare car, or a friend ready to lend one immediately (backup system).
That backup car plan = your Disaster Recovery Strategy
The same idea applies to tech systems — when one data center crashes, another takes over.

Why Disaster Recovery Matters
	• Downtime = Money loss (think: Amazon loses ~$220K per minute during outage)
	• User Trust: Users switch quickly if your app is down.
	• Compliance: Some industries (finance, healthcare) require DR planning.

Core Components of Disaster Recovery
Term	Meaning
RTO (Recovery Time Objective)	How quickly can you restore service?
RPO (Recovery Point Objective)	How much data loss is acceptable? (e.g., last 5 mins of transactions)
Backup	Copy of your data/config stored separately
Failover	Switching from primary to backup system automatically
Replication	Continuous copying of data to another location
Redundancy	Having multiple systems ready in parallel

Common Disaster Recovery Strategies
Let’s break down the 4 major DR strategies 

	1. Backup & Restore (Low Cost, Slow Recovery)
	• Take daily or hourly backups (e.g., to S3, Google Cloud Storage).
	• In case of disaster, restore the backup to a new environment.
	• Cheapest, but high RTO (can take hours to recover).
A startup stores MySQL backups on AWS S3 nightly.
If production fails, they spin up a new EC2 instance and restore last night’s backup.

	2. Pilot Light (Small-Scale Warm Backup)
	• Keep a minimal version of your environment running in another region.
	• During disaster → scale it up quickly.
AWS keeps critical services (databases, configurations) always running in a secondary region.
When primary fails, auto-scaling kicks in and spins up full infrastructure.

	3. Warm Standby (Partial Capacity Always On)
	• Keep a scaled-down but fully functional clone of production running in another region.
	• Automatically redirect traffic during failure.
An e-commerce site keeps a 50% capacity cluster live in Europe while primary runs in North America.
If NA fails, Europe scales to 100%.

	4. Active-Active (High Cost, Instant Recovery)
	• Both (or multiple) regions are fully active simultaneously.
	• Real-time data replication between them.
	• Traffic load balanced globally.
	• Near-zero downtime, near-zero data loss.
Netflix and Google Cloud operate in multi-region active-active mode — if one region goes down, users are instantly routed to another.
