What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?

imple Definition
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a global network of servers (called edge servers) that store and deliver content closer to users, so websites and APIs load faster and more reliably.
Instead of every user hitting one central server, users are served from the nearest location.

Problem Without CDN (Explain This First)
Imagine:
Your Spring Boot app is hosted in Toronto
A user opens your site from India

Without CDN:
Request travels India → Canada → India

High latency (slow response)
Server load increases
Poor user experience

Solution With CDN
✔ With CDN:
Static content (images, JS, CSS, PDFs) is cached at edge locations

User is served from nearest edge
Faster response
Origin server load is reduced

What Does CDN Actually Cache?
Content Type	Cached by CDN?
Images (PNG, JPG)	✅ Yes
CSS / JS files	✅ Yes
Videos	✅ Yes
PDFs	✅ Yes
API Responses-	⚠️ Sometimes (with headers)
Personalized data-	❌ Usually No

CDN Architecture
Key Components:-
Client (Browser / Mobile App)
CDN Edge Server (closest to user)
Origin Server (your Spring Boot app)
Cache Rules (TTL, headers)

Request Flow (Very Important for Interview)
User → CDN Edge
       ├─ Cache HIT  → Response from Edge
       └─ Cache MISS → Request to Origin → Cache → Response
